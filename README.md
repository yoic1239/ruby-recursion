# Ruby-recursion
The followings are two recursion exercises.

## Assignment 1
1. Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
2. Write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively.

## Assignment 2
Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology. An input of [3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1] should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and an input of [105, 79, 100, 110] should return [79, 100, 105, 110].
